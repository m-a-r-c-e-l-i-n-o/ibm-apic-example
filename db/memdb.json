Seen here in 1930, manufacturing employees of IBM's Dayton Scale Company are assembling Dayton Safety Electric Meat Choppers. These devices, which won the Gold Medal at the 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition in Philadelphia, were produced in both counter base and pedestal styles (5000 and 6000 series, respectively). They included one-quarter horsepower models, one-third horsepower machines (Styles 5113, 6113F and 6213F), one-half horsepower types (Styles 5117, 6117F and 6217F) and one horsepower choppers (Styles 5128, 6128F and 6228F). Prices in 1926 varied from $180 to $375. Three years after this photograph was taken, the Dayton Scale Company became an IBM division, and was sold to the Hobart Manufacturing Company in 1934.\",\"id\":13401,\"img\":\"api/containers/items/download/meat-chopper.jpg\",\"img_alt\":\"Dayton Meat Chopper\",\"name\":\"Dayton Meat Chopper\",\"price\":4599.99,\"rating\":0}",
      "13402": "{\"description\":\"This equipment is representative of the tabulating system invented and built for the U.S. Census Bureau by Herman Hollerith (1860-1929). After observing a train conductor punching railroad tickets to identify passengers, Hollerith conceived and developed the idea of using punched holes to record facts about people. These machines were first used in compiling the 1890 Census. Hollerith's patents were later acquired by the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (which was renamed IBM in 1924) and this work became the basis of the IBM Punched Card System. Hollerith's tabulator used simple clock-like counting devices. When an electrical circuit was closed (through a punched hole in a predetermined position on the card), each counter was actuated by an electromagnet. The unit's pointer (clock hand) moved one step each time the magnet was energized. The circuits to the electromagnets were closed by means of a hand-operated press type card reader. The operator placed each card in the reader, pulled down the lever and removed the card after each punched hole was counted.\",\"id\":13402,\"img\":\"api/containers/items/download/hollerith-tabulator.jpg\",\"img_alt\":\"Hollerith Tabulator\",\"name\":\"Hollerith Tabulator\",\"price\":10599.99,\"rating\":0}",

Six years later, Edward Canby and Orange Ozias of Dayton, Ohio, purchased Pitrat's patents and incorporated The Computing Scale Company as the world's first computing scale vendor. And four years after that, The Computing Scale Company introduced the first automatic computing scale, shown here. In 1911, the Computing Scale Company merged with the International Time Recording Company and Tabulating Machine Company to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, a business that was renamed IBM in 1924.\",\"id\":13403,\"img\":\"api/containers/items/download/computing-scale.jpg\",\"img_alt\":\"Computing Scale\",\"name\":\"Computing Scale\",\"price\":699.99,\"rating\":0}",

Doty went on to write the specifications for a tape-to-card converter for engineers in IBM’s development laboratory in Endicott, N.Y. The first such machine consisted of a keypunch to which relays had been added to convert the code of the paper tape to the code of the punched cards, along with an attached paper-tape reading device. The engineering model was delivered and placed into testing on May 12, 1941, just three months after getting the green light for development. During the summer of 1941, the United States Army Air Corps received the first 10 units of the machine seen here, which was then known as the IBM 40 Tape Controlled Card Punch. Following delivery to the Air Corps, the Army’s Quartermaster Department, Signal Corps and other military organizations used the IBM 40, and its counterpart IBM 57 card-to-tape punch, for defense work during World War II. Commercial installations of both machines were also made at the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad; RCA; Bethlehem Steel; Vanity Fair; Western Electric; Merrill Lynch; Harris Upsham and others.\",\"id\":13404,\"img\":\"api/containers/items/download/tape-controlled-punch.jpg\",\"img_alt\":\"Tape Controlled Card Punch\",\"name\":\"Tape Controlled Card Punch\",\"price\":1299.99,\"rating\":0}",

As a filing machine, the Type 77 fed and compared simultaneously two groups of punched cards: records already in file and records to be filed. These two groups were merged in correct numerical or alphabetical sequence. When operated for the purpose of pulling cards, the Type 77 made it possible for one group of cards to pull corresponding cards from another group. Introduced in 1937, the IBM 77 collator rented for $80 a month. It was capable of handling 240 cards a minute, and was 40.5 inches long and 51 inches high. IBM withdrew the Type 77 from marketing on November 27, 1957.\",\"id\":13405,\"img\":\"api/containers/items/download/electric-card-punch.jpg\",\"img_alt\":\"IBM 77 Electric Punched Card Collator\",\"name\":\"Electric Card Collator\",\"price\":3899.99,\"rating\":0}",

Announced in April 1955, the 608 began the transition of IBM's line of small and intermediate electronic calculators from vacuum tube to transistor operation. It contained more than 3,000 transistors -- tiny germanium devices no bigger than a paper clip -- and magnetic cores -- doughnut-shaped objects slightly larger than a pinhead, in the first known use of transistors and cores together in a computer. The magnetic cores could remember information indefinitely and recall it in a few millionths of a second, and made up the machine's internal storage or memory.<br>The 608's transistors made possible a 50 percent reduction in physical size and a 90 percent reduction in power requirements over comparable vacuum tube models. The machine could perform 4,500 additions a second, a computing speed 2.5 times faster than IBM's Type 607 calculator introduced only two years before. It could multiply two 9-digit numbers and derive the 18-digit product in 11 one-thousandths of a second, and divide an 18-digit number by a nine-digit number to produce the nine-digit quotient in just 13 one-thousandths of a second. The associated IBM 535 card read punch (shown at right) was used for both input and output, and was designed to permit a card to be calculated and the results punched while passing through the machine at the rate of 155 cards per minute.<br>In 1957, customers could purchase the 608 for $83,210 (or rent it for $1,760 a month) and the 535 for $44,838 (or rent it for $715 a month).
